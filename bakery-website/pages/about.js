          <p className="text-lg mb-8">
            I'm Theodore James Washington III (Teddy), a Detroit native who is self-taught after years of immersing myself in baking and pastry arts.

            <h3 className="text-2xl mb-4 font-playfair">Early Beginnings</h3>
            <p className="text-lg mb-8">
              My love for baking began at a very young age and was fostered by both my parents. During my homeschooling (1 year), the Martha Stewart show introduced me to wedding cakes. With my mother, Classie's encouragement and use of her KitchenAid, I was able to explore and foster my talent over the years. With inspiration drawn from continued observation of pioneers Sylvia Weinstock, RBI Cakes, and Colette Peters, I set out to share my unique perspective.

            <p className="text-lg mb-8">
              Through hands-on experience, I have developed tried-and-true methods of scratch recipe formulation. In 2007, I was awarded for "Exemplary Form, Taste, and Quality" in SkillsUSA Regional, State, and National competitions.

            <p className="text-lg mb-8">
              Over nine years ago, I moved to Nashville and had the privilege of working with Nashville Cares, helping process insurance claims, facilitating community meetings, drafting legislation, and bridging the gap between Nashville residents and the various departments of Metro Nashville.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg mb-8">
              During the pandemic, I gained clarity on my direction and transitioned back to the kitchen. I had the opportunity to present bespoke desserts at Hillwood Country Club and Layer Cake, pioneered the banquet program, and created freely as The 404 Kitchen Executive Pastry Chef.

            <p className="text-lg mb-8">
              While it has been rewarding to gain experience on multiple platforms, I have had my own daydreams and ideas about what I would like to present to the world. Pulling from the memories, tastes, and gifts given to me from the many women in my life, whom most have long passed. I'm setting out to share those experiences of love, joy and memories in the form of baked goods. Not just sweet but balanced and using the absolute best ingredients possible when in season.
